			<p class="card__long-bio">The name comes from the animal's reported habit of attacking and drinking the blood of livestock (from Spanish literally "goat-sucker"; from "chupar", "to suck", and "cabra", "goat"), especially goats. Reportedly Chupacabra was seen more than 200 times during 2010 in Puerto Rico alone. Since then the numbers are just rising. But according to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an urban legend.</p>
